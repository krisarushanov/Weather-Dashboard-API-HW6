### API
Weather Dashboard uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) by making two calls. One call is made with the 5 Day forecast API and the other using Current weather Data API.

Here is an example of the 5 Day forecast API call which will use the search box input to generate the city data.
